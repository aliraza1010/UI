          <b>7 Day GM Diet Plan for Weight Loss</b><br></br><br></br>
          The original GM Diet Plan was developed by General Motors, with the help of the Food and Drug Administration and the United States Department of Agriculture, in 1985 for its employees. The idea was to make these employees healthier, and in the process, improve workforce productivity. The initial results were impressive and the workers underwent significant weight loss in just a week which showed improved efficiency, energy and confidence. While the GM Diet Plan for weight loss was deemed a success and is considered easy to follow, most nutritionists do not recommend that you follow it. Although it results in immediate weight loss, the diet also has several side effects that we will be discussing later in the article. At HealthifyMe, we believe one should aim to follow a balanced diet that would ensure weight loss while also helping the body absorb the nutrients it requires. If you’re looking for a diet chart to help you lose weight and keep you healthy, we suggest you take a look at the best Indian diet plan for weight loss.<br></br>

          <br></br>Start the diet by consuming as many fruits as you wish to on the very first day as there are no specific instructions on the quantity and when one should eat them. However, watermelons and muskmelons are highly recommended since they contain high amounts of fiber, you can also include apples, oranges, and papaya in your diet.<br></br>
          <br></br>Another important part of the diet would be to consume 8 to 12 glasses of water in the day and one must avoid starving at any point of the day. If you’re hungry at any time, feel free to eat some fruits and satisfy your hunger.<br></br>
          <br></br>These fiber-rich and low-fat foods keep an individual full for longer, thereby reducing an individual’s calorie intake. The high water intake will also serve to flush out the toxins from the body and prepare it for the rest of the diet.<br></br>

          <br></br>Unlike the first day, the second day of the GM Diet involves eating just vegetables. These veggies can be consumed raw or can be cooked in order to make them palatable. Also, ensure that there is no oil involved in their preparation.<br></br>
          <br></br>Another important part of the diet would be to consume 8 to 12 glasses of water in the day and one must avoid starving at any point of the day. If you’re hungry at any time, feel free to eat some fruits and satisfy your hunger.<br></br>
          <br></br>If you choose to eat potatoes, avoid choosing unhealthy options like deep-fried, or even a packet of your favorite brand of chips, though you can snack on vegetables at any time of the day if you’re hungry. If absolutely required, olive oil or butter can be used sparingly for flavour.<br></br>

          <br></br>On the third day of the diet, one must stick to eating a combination of fruits and vegetables. These foods could be the same as those consumed in the first two days. However, the only foods that must be avoided are potatoes and bananas.<br></br>
          <br></br>You would also need to include 8 to 12 glasses of water in order to flush out all toxins from the body. In addition to replenishing your body and giving the body all the nutrients it needs, you can also add the GM Diet Soup to your diet on the third day. This change will also help satisfy your taste buds and break the monotony of the first two days.<br></br>
